# javascript-text-based-RPG
This is a rework of a javascript implementation of a simple ascii art RPG game using classes and variables with names that make sense. There is a worse version of this online at [https://yeoldequiveringcommunistzombies.com/](yeoldequiveringcommunistzombies.com).

# Tasks

## Difficulty
The tasks are broken down in 3 difficulty levels, X, XX, and XXX, with XXX being the hardest. This is the knowleadge required for each of the difficulties.

- X - Simple understanding of OOP (Objects/Inheritance/Classes) and ability to work with basic javascript operands and variables

- XX - In depth understanding of OOP and ability to create new Systems based on OOP. In depth understanding of the codebase and knowleadge of the DOM interaction

- XXX - Fluent in JS and OOP. Proficent understanding of the browser, being able to work with cookies, understanding the css specificity system, proficent in CSS Pseudo elements, great knowleadge of modern coding conventions. Ability to create algorithms and ability to rewrite code to make the codebase more efficient and more straightforward. Also indepth knowleadge of the JSDOC syntax and good comment writing skills. Design knowleadge is required and must have a good understanding of how to create modern and intuitive UIs and UXs.

## Task marking convention

- `CON` This concept needs to be reviewed from the perspective of a game designer and the process of implementing it needs to be planned out.
- `POST` This is a task for the future. This task is too ahead or too advanced for the current codebase
