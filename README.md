# javascript-text-based-RPG
This is a rework of a javascript implementation of a simple ascii art RPG game using classes and variables with names that make sense. There is a <strike>worse</strike> version of this online at [https://yeoldequiveringcommunistzombies.com/](yeoldequiveringcommunistzombies.com).

This game is used to facilitate an after-school computer club for high school students (ages 15 to 18). 

Many, many, many thanks go to Daniel and Ethan who beautifully rewrote the entire thing while muttering and complaining about doing their homework in Python. 
I would also be remiss not to thank previous generations of students who contributed their beautiful light and humor to this project. 

May the code flow. 

# Tasks

## Difficulty
The coding tasks are broken down in 3 difficulty levels, X, XX, and XXX, with XXX being the hardest. The game design tasks are broken down in 3 difficulties, GB, GD, and GM, both requiring different skillsets. This is the knowledge required for each of the difficulties.

- X - Simple understanding of OOP (Objects/Inheritance/Classes) and ability to work with basic javascript operands and variables. Simple knowleadge of HTML and CSS.

- XX - In depth understanding of OOP and ability to create new Systems based on OOP. In depth understanding of the codebase and knowleadge of the DOM interaction

- XXX - Fluent in JS and OOP. Proficent understanding of the browser, being able to work with cookies, understanding the css specificity system, proficent in CSS Pseudo elements, great knowleadge of modern coding conventions. Ability to create algorithms and ability to rewrite code to make the codebase more efficient and more straightforward. Also indepth knowleadge of the JSDOC syntax and good comment writing skills. Design knowleadge is required and must have a good understanding of how to create modern and intuitive UIs and UXs.

- GD - Game design. You will need to be creative. You will create new mechanics/items/weapons for the game. They have to be enjoyable, add some kind of new concept into the game (the item's can't be too repetative) and be somewhat funny and fitting with the theme of the game. Basic knowleage of game balance and game math is required but nothing too advanced as weapons can be rebalanced and calculated in the future. 

- GB - Game balance. Video game knowleage. Ability to make changes to weapons/items/mechanics to make the more realistic, enjoyable. You will need to balance out the game's properties to make all the items viable options (no completely useless items that have no purpose what-so-ever) and make no weapons overpowered (too easy to obtain, break the game, and invalidate all alternatives).

- GM - Game math. You need to know math, functions, parabolas and stuff like that (be able to make graphs mostly). You will be required to make functions to calculate XP requirements, damage, and general calculations related with the game

## Task marking convention

- `CON` This concept needs to be reviewed from the perspective of a game designer and the process of implementing it needs to be planned out.
- `POST` This is a task for the future. This task is too ahead or too advanced for the current codebase

## Task List

### XXX
* Persistant data in cookies `CON`
* Procedural Terrain Generation (with zoning) `POST`
* Projectiles `POST`
* Split characters and structures (allow spiders to walk into berry bushes)

### XX
* Towns (buy / sell stores) `POST`
* Quests
* NPC's `CON`
* Shortcuts and help screen
* Random events (fires, zombie apocalypse?, spider infestation) `CON`
* Joe's all you can eat buffet (i'm not gonna question when this was here, why this was here, or who put this here, just gonna leave it) `CON`
* Building (Placing walls and building fortifications) `POST` `CON`
* Player render distance (sight)
* Make achievement tab resizable

### X
* Implement landing page
* Max health
* Credits (don't forget to add https://game-icons.net/)
* More stats for items (more than just defence)
* Add item slot for weapons

### GD
* More weapons
* More crafting recipes
* More objects
* More enemies
