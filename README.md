# javascript-text-based-RPG
As I embark on my journey to learn javascript, I have a clear idea of what I want to build. A dwarven-fortress like game in javascript. The game is also used as a fun after-school activity for my students. :-) 

There is an online version of this, https://yeoldequiveringcommunistzombies.com/




This is a javascript implementation of a simple ascii art RPG game
